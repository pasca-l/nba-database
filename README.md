# NBA Database

## Project Overview
This project holds codes for a [NBA database website](https://pasca-l.github.io/nba-database/index.html). This website has information about the players, teams, matches, and goods related to NBA.

The webpage above is directed to a plain HTML, containing information about the queries written with SuperSQL[^supersql]. Data collection[^basketballref] (scraping) was done by using a Python script, which then was uploaded to the database using PostgreSQL.

[^supersql]: [SuperSQL](http://ssqldev.db.ics.keio.ac.jp)
[^basketballref]: Data collected from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
