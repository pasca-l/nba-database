# NBA Database

## Project Overview
This project holds codes for a [NBA database website](https://pasca-l.github.io/nba-database/index.html).

The webpage above is directed to a plain HTML, containing information about the queries written with SuperSQL. [^supersql] Data collection (scraping) was done by using a Python script, which then was uploaded to the database using PostgreSQL.
